Design the Dashboard
Now, let’s focus on creating the actual visuals for the dashboard. Here are some common metrics and visuals for a hospital data dashboard:

1. Patient Overview
Total Patients: A card or KPI showing the total number of patients.
Patient Demographics: Pie chart or bar chart showing the distribution of patients by age, gender.

2. Hospital Performance
Average Wait Time: A KPI or bar chart showing the average time patients wait to receive care.

Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive and visually appealing hospital data dashboard in Power BI. The key is to have a clean and well-structured dataset, and then leverage Power BI’s various visualizations and features to create a meaningful report that provides actionable insights for hospital management.
